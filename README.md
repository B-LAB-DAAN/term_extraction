# Equation Term Extraction Using NLP and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to extract mathematical equation terms from scientific abstracts.

**Implemented Models:**
- **Logistic Regression:** Classifies equation-related terms using TF-IDF.
- **Conditional Random Fields (CRF):** Recognizes term sequences based on contextual relationships.
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** Groups terms into topic-based clusters for better interpretability.

The dataset consists of 100 filtered mathematical research abstracts from the ArXiv Metadata Dataset.
